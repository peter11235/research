The Potential of Kinect in Education
by Hui-mei Justina Hsu

2010 & 2011 Horizon report predicts gesture-recognition tech will be adopted in education w/in 5 yrs. (now)

IRF -> surface interactivity

Interactivity w/ ICT:
  1. No Interactivity: ICT simply presents contents
  2. Authoritative: students controlled by predetermined responses and fixed procedures
  3. Dialectic: Allow studentes more freedom of interaction
  4. Dialogic: ""
  5. Synergistic: ""
  
3 Primary modes of learning: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic
  - Theory of Multiple intelligences 
  


Role of haptic feedback:
  - Claimed to have positive impact on learning
  - 5-yr-olds learning phonetics by tracing words while pronouncing and looking at them
  - College students w/ disabilities use Wii (tennis) and Kinect (bowling) to improve real-world performance
  
Kinect can do anything IWB can do

Six themes from which IWBs derive benefits:
  1. Flexibility/versitility
  2. Multimedia presentation
  3. Efficiency
  4. Support of planning and dev of resources
  5. Modeling ICT skills
  6. Interactivity
  
#6 is most valuable

Characteristics of Kinect that make it conducive to teaching/learning:
  1. Flexible b/c don't need physical input device (keyboard, joystick)
  2. Accomodates multiple users
  3. Versitile (kind of same as #1) 
  4. Engaging
  
Affordances:
  1. stimulating & realistic -> motivating
  2. Can interact via 3 primary modes of learning: vis, aud, kin.
  3. Collects lots of data that can be used in software apps (like Scratch and MMD)
  
Technical Constraints:
  1. Space: need a lot of it
  2. Calibration: takes time, multiple users complicates things
  3. Few software apps

Future work:
  - "Customized software to facilitate classroom interactions and to create kinect-enabled contents seems to be missing in the picture of current technology integration"
  - "Software needs to incorporate the design of interactive pedagogy in order to exploit its technical interactivity"
